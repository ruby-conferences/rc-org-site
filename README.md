# Ruby Events

[rubyconferences.org][r] is a basic list of Ruby conferences, published
collaboratively with the Ruby community. Filtered event news is available in the
[feed][f] and [@rubyconferences][t].

## Eligible Conferences

Focus is a goal of this project and as a result, only events that are
specifically for Ruby are listed. That means that if an event covers Ruby,
but is not specifically for Rubyists, then it is left out.

A good rule of thumb for whether an events should be included is if its name
includes either Ruby or Rails and how it describes itself. An events that
describes itself as a "Events on Web Development" might be an awesome event,
but it's probably not a Ruby event.

## Filtered Event News

In an effort to keep the news focused, only the following items are covered:

* Dates announced
* Call for Proposal life cycle
* Registration life cycle
* Conference videos posted

A brand new event would also be covered by a news item.

### Life Cycle News

Both an event's call for proposals and registration are life cycle news - they
have an announcement and a deadline. This type of news is covered by the
following items:

* An announcement
* A reminder a week before the deadline
* A reminder the day before the deadline
